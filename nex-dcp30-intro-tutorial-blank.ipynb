    "Climate change remains to be one of the most critical issues facing the United States today.\n",
    "Climate action requires thoughtful policy-making from local and county governments all the way up to the national level. This notebook is a tutorial on leveraging the NEX-DCP30 dataset developed by NASA Earth Exchange for local climate action. The goal is to  inform policymakers and government officials with tangible insights on potential impacts.  \n",

    "This notebook was produced for the final project of EDS 220 - Remote Sensing. It provides instruction and example code on how to pull in the NASA Earth Exchange climate projection data directly from the source. It provides specific use case examples for Santa Barbara county. Specifically, this workbook shows how local governments and economy sectors could plan for different climate scenarios from the dataset.\n"

    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Description\n",
    "The modelled data is generated by NASA from the General Circulation Model(GCM) runs under 33 different Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5(CMIP5) models. The modelled data projections are available for four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios known as Representative Concentration Pathways(RCPs) labelled after the range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 (2.6, 4.5, 6, and 8.5 W/m2). The 2.6 W/m2 scenario is the least extreme and the 8.5 W/m2 scenario is the most extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precipitation data is provided as a monthly mean of the daily precipitation rate in units of kg/m2s\n",
    "- Temperature data is provided as a monthly mean of the daily predicted temperature in units of degrees K\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coverage\n",
    "The data spatially covers the contiguous US at a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds/0.00833 degrees (approximately 800 meters). The temoporal coverage of the data is made up of a \"Retrospective Run\" (1950-2005), and a \"Prospective Run\" (2006-2099).\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Format\n",
    "Data is in netcdf files accessed through ncml format. Ncml is an XML representation of metadata in an NetCDF file. \n",
    "The data file contains the following information:\n",
    "- One monthly averaged value for each month from 2006 to 2099\n",
    "- Monthly average can be based off of daily min, max, average and quartiles for each constituent\n",
    "- The openDAP access allows you to subset the variables, region and time extent of your interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval\n",
    "In this example, dataset will be accessed through the THREDDS OpenDAP services to avoid download of large files in repo. However, there are many other way to access the data including options such as Netcdfsubset.\n",
    "https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-dcp30\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias Correction-Spatial Disaggregation (BSCD)\n",
    "***Problem: Biased data unsuitable for local level decision making.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Original GCM model runs are run at coarse resolution which is not at the level of detail required for local decision making. In addition, although the projections are globally accurate there may be considerable bias at the local level since it does not take into account local topography.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Solution: BSCD using PRISM (observational climate data from meteorological stations)***\n",
    "\n",
    "**PRISM Dataset Description:** A set of monthly, yearly, and single-event gridded data products including mean temperature and precipitation and max/min temperatures developed from point measurements of precipitation, temperature, and other climatic factors primarily for the United States. In-situ point measurements are ingested into the PRISM (Parameter elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model) statistical mapping system. The PRISM products use a weighted regression scheme to account for complex climate regimes associated with orography, rain shadows, temperature inversions, slope aspect, coastal proximity, and other factors. Climatologies (normals) are available at 30-arcsec (800 meters) and monthly data are available at 2.5 arcmin (4 km) resolution. (Daly, Christopher & National Center for Atmospheric Research Staff, 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bias-Correction step corrects the bias of the GCM data through comparisons performed against the observationally-based PRISM data.\n",
    "The Spatial-Disaggregation step spatially interpolates the bias-corrected GCM data to the finer resolution grid of the 30-arc second PRISM data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "Relative spatial patterns in temperature and precipitation observed from 1950 through 2005 will remain constant under future climate change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does not add information beyond what is contained in the original CMIP5 scenarios, and preserves the frequency of periods of anomalously high and low temperature or precipitation (i.e., extreme events) within each individual CMIP5 scenario.\n"
