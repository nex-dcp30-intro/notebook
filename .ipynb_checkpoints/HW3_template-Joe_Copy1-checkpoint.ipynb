    "\n",
    "### General Description\n",
    "The modelled data is generated by NASA from the General Circulation Model(GCM) runs under 33 different Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5(CMIP5) models. The modelled data projections are available for four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios known as Representative Concentration Pathways(RCPs) labelled after the range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 (2.6, 4.5, 6, and 8.5 W/m2). The 2.6 W/m2 scenario is the least extreme and the 8.5 W/m2 scenario is the most extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precipitation data is provided as a monthly mean of the daily precipitation rate in units of kg/m2s\n",
    "- Temperature data is provided as a monthly mean of the daily predicted temperature in units of degrees K\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coverage\n",
    "The data spatially covers the contiguous US at a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds/0.00833 degrees (approximately 800 meters). The temoporal coverage of the data is made up of a \"Retrosoective Run\" (1950-2005), and a \"Prospective Run\" (2006-2099).\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Format\n",
    "Data is in netcdf files. It contains the following information:\n",
    "- One monthly averaged value for each month from 2006 to 2099\n",
    "- Monthly average can be based off of daily min, max, average and quartiles for each constituent\n",
    "- Your selected file will contain the variables you request for the spatial and temporal subset you specify in the NetcdfSubset access url \n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval\n",
    "**INSESRT**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "Relative spatial patterns in temperature and precipitation observed from 1950 through 2005 will remain constant under future climate change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does not add information beyond what is contained in the original CMIP5 scenarios, and preserves the frequency of periods of anomalously high and low temperature or precipitation (i.e., extreme events) within each individual CMIP5 scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias Correction-Spatial Disaggregation (BSCD)\n",
    "***Problem: Biased data unsuitable for local level decision making.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Original GCM model runs are run at coarse resolution which is not at the level of detail required for local decision making. In addition, although the projections are globally accurate there may be considerable bias at the local level since it does not take into account local topography.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Solution: BSCD using PRISM (observational climate data from meteorological stations)***\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bias-Correction step corrects the bias of the GCM data through comparisons performed against the observationally-based PRISM data.\n",
    "The Spatial-Disaggregation step spatially interpolates the bias-corrected GCM data to the finer resolution grid of the 30-arc second PRISM data."

    "\n",
    "1) Import all necessary packages (matplotlib, numpy, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Set any parameters that will be needed during subsequent portions of the notebook. Typical examples of parameters include:\n",
    "- names of any directories where data are stored\n",
    "- ranges of years over which data are valid\n",
    "- any thresholds or latitude/longitude ranges to be used later (e.g. dimensions of NINO3.4 region, threshold SSTA values for El Nino, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Read in the data! If the data files are very large, you may want to consider subsetting the portion of files to be read in (see examples of this during notebooks provided in Weeks 7 and 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "_Since we will be running these notebooks in class during Weeks 9 and 10_, here is a good rule of thumb: It's good to aim for a relatively short amount of time needed to read in the data, since otherwise we'll be sitting around waiting for things to load for a long time. A  minute or two for data I/O is probably the max you'll want to target!"

The filename should be \"environment.yml\": an example that you can use for the proper syntax is included in this template repo. To determine which packages to include, you'll probably want to start by displaying the packages loaded in your environment: you can use the command `conda list -n [environment_name]` to get a list.\n",
